SQL Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Analytics Portfolio, a dynamic collection of SQL projects where data storytelling meets rigorous analysis. Through the lens of SQL, I delve into fascinating datasets, uncovering trends, insights, and answers to complex questions across a diverse range of domains.

Project Highlights
International Student Mental Health Analysis: Leveraging data from a 2018 study by a Japanese university, this project investigates the impact of studying abroad on mental health. It explores how social connectedness and acculturative stress influence depression among international students, offering a data-driven look into the challenges faced by students far from home.

American Baby Name Trends: An exploration into the evolving landscape of American baby names. Using advanced SQL techniques, this project tracks naming trends over the years, revealing cultural shifts and the timeless nature of some names.

Global Debt Analysis: A deep dive into international debt data, examining the financial obligations countries bear on the global stage. This project provides insights into economic patterns and the varying scales of debt across nations.

And More: The repository is not confined to these themes alone. My curiosity and analytical drive propel me into various other domains, where I employ SQL to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Approach and Techniques
My projects are characterized by the application of advanced SQL queries, including but not limited to:

Joins: Merging data from multiple tables to enrich analyses.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Structuring queries for clarity and maintainability.
Window Functions: Performing calculations across rows of data to uncover trends and metrics.
Each project is a journey through data, with SQL as the guide. From initial exploration to detailed analysis, I strive to illuminate the stories hidden within numbers and foster a deeper understanding of the subjects at hand.

Purpose
This repository serves as a showcase of my analytical capabilities and a platform for continuous learning. It reflects my passion for data analysis and my commitment to leveraging SQL for insightful, data-driven storytelling.

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or just curious, I invite you to explore my projects. Dive into the datasets, discover the insights, and feel the impact of data well-analyzed.

Welcome to a world where data speaks volumes, and SQL is the language.
